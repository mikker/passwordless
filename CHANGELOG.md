### Breaking changes

This version moves from storing the session information in the `cookies` to the `session`.
Your users will therefore have to sign in again after upgrading.

To provide a smoother experience, you can use the provided session upgrade helper like this:

```ruby
def current_user
  @current_user ||=
    authenticate_by_session(User) ||
    upgrade_passwordless_cookie(User)
end
```

- Deprecates `authenticate_by_cookie`, use `authenticate_by_session`.([#56](https://github.com/mikker/passwordless/pull/56))

### Added

- `restrict_token_reuse` disables session reuse ([#51](https://github.com/mikker/passwordless/pull/51))

### Changed

- Optionally pass `request` to `after_session_save` ([#49](https://github.com/mikker/passwordless/pull/49))
- Sign in via `Passwordless::Session` instead of authenticatable and store it in `session` instead of `cookies` ([#56](https://github.com/mikker/passwordless/pull/56))
- `sign_in` helper now expects a `Passwordless::Session`.
